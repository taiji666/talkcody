## What is a Share Link?

The share link feature allows you to generate a dedicated link for your AI conversation tasks, making it easy to share your work with others. Recipients don't need to install TalkCody or log in to an account - they can view the conversation directly through their browser.

Share links are suitable for: code reviews, knowledge sharing, teaching demonstrations, team collaboration, and more.
</Callout>

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **No Login Required** | Recipients can view directly in the browser without an account |
| **Path Privacy Protection** | Automatically converts local file paths (e.g., `/Users/xxx/`) to `~` to protect privacy |
| **Tool Output Display** | Perfectly displays execution results from tools like readFile, writeFile, editFile, codeSearch |
| **Password Protection** | Optional password setting to prevent unauthorized access |
| **Expiration Time** | Supports 1 day, 7 days, 30 days, or never expire |

## How to Use

### Create a Share Link

1. **Open the Share Dialog**
   
   In any task conversation, click the **Share Icon** button in the top-right corner of the chat panel.

2. **Configure Share Options**
   
   In the popup share dialog, you can set:
   
   - **Expiration Time**: Select the link's validity period
     - 1 day
     - 7 days

   </Callout>

### Viewing the Shared Page

Recipients of the share link will see:

- **Conversation Title**: The name of the task
- **Model Information**: The AI model used
- **Message List**: Complete conversation content, including user questions, AI responses, and tool execution results
- **Code Blocks**: Syntax highlighting and copy functionality
- **Tool Outputs**: File operations, search results, etc. displayed in a friendly format

<Callout type="tip">
Code blocks have a copy button in the top-right corner - click it to copy the code content.
</Callout>

## Share Content Notes

### What Will Be Shared

- All messages in the conversation (user and AI)
- Tool calls used by AI and their output results
- Code blocks, file paths, search results, etc.

### What Won't Be Shared

- Full local file paths (automatically converted to `~`)
- Sensitive command outputs (like API keys, Tokens, etc.)
- Your personal account information

## Best Practices

1. **Sensitive Information**: Check the conversation content before sharing to ensure no sensitive information is leaked
2. **Password Protection**: For sensitive content, it's recommended to enable password protection
3. **Reasonable Expiration**: Choose an appropriate expiration time based on the use case
4. **Timely Cleanup**: Delete share links that are no longer needed
