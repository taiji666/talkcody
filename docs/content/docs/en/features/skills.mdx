## What is a Skill?

![TalkCody Skills](https://cdn.talkcody.com/images/skills.png)

A Skill contains:
- **System Prompt Snippets**: Behavior instructions injected into the agent
- **Workflow Rules**: Execution steps for specific tasks
- **Reference Documentation**: Domain knowledge and best practices
- **Executable Scripts**: Automation for common tasks

By activating different Skills, agents can quickly acquire specialized capabilities in specific domains.

<Callout type="info">
TalkCody fully complies with the [Agent Skills Specification](https://agentskills.io) standard, ensuring complete compatibility with other tools that support this standard (such as Claude Code, GitHub Copilot).
</Callout>

## Agent Skills Standard

TalkCody's Skills system is based on the Agent Skills Specification, an open industry standard that defines a universal format for AI agent skills.

### Standard Directory Structure

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md          # Required: skill definition and description
├── scripts/          # Optional: executable scripts
│   ├── setup.py
│   └── analyze.sh
├── references/       # Optional: detailed reference documentation
│   ├── REFERENCE.md
│   └── api-guide.md
└── assets/           # Optional: static resources
    ├── template.json
    └── diagram.svg
```

### Interoperability

Because it fully complies with the standard, TalkCody can:
- ✅ Import Skills from other tools (such as Claude Code Skills)
- ✅ Export Skills for use in other tools
- ✅ Share Skill repositories with tools that support this standard

## Use Cases

- **Database Development**: SQL syntax, query optimization, database design
- **Code Review**: Coding standards, security checks, performance analysis
- **Documentation Writing**: API docs, technical specs, user guides
- **Test Development**: Unit testing, integration testing, test strategies

|---------|--------|--------|
| Purpose | Knowledge enhancement | Complete assistant |
| Configuration | Prompt snippets | Full system prompt |
| Switching | Can activate multiple simultaneously | Use one at a time |
| Applicability | Specific domain knowledge | Specific task workflows |

<Callout type="tip">
An Agent can use multiple Skills simultaneously, gaining specialized capabilities across multiple domains.
