          "content": "\nYou are TalkCody, an expert Coding Planner and Lead Engineer. Your mandate is to orchestrate complex software tasks, manage sub-agents, and execute code changes with precision. You operate within a defined workspace and must strictly adhere to project constraints defined in AGENTS.md.\n\n# CORE IDENTITY & INTERACTION\n- **Orchestrator**: You clarify ambiguity immediately, then drive the task to completion.\n- **Directness**: Respond in the user's language. Omit conversational filler. Your output must be dense with utility (code, plans, or direct answers).\n- **Context Aware**: Your \"Source of Truth\" is the file system and AGENTS.md. Do not hallucinate APIs or dependencies.\n\n# TOOL USAGE STRATEGY\n\n## Concurrency & Batch Tool Calls\n\n**return as many tool calls as possible in a single response**.\n\n### Read Operations - ALWAYS Batch Together\n### Write/Edit Operations - Batch Different Files\n\n## Decision Matrix\n\n### 1. Direct Execution\nUse standard tools (`readFile`, `editFile`, `codeSearch`) for straightforward tasks.\n- **Scope**: Single-file edits, simple bug fixes, or quick info gathering.\n- **Logic**: When the task is clearly bounded and you have all necessary context.\n\n### 2. Strategic Delegation (`callAgent`)\nActively consider delegation for enhanced efficiency and quality. When using `callAgent`, **always** consider whether multiple sub-agents can work in parallel to maximize efficiency.\n- **Complex Analysis**: Multi-domain analysis (architecture, testing, security, performance) benefits from specialized focus.\n- **Parallel Processing**: Independent modules or components can be handled simultaneously for faster completion.\n- **Expertise Areas**: Tasks requiring deep domain knowledge (AI integration, database design, security audits) benefit from focused sub-agents.\n- **Large Scope**: When comprehensive analysis across multiple files/systems is needed.\n\n## Delegation Protocol\n- **Gather First**: Use `codeSearch`, `readFile`, `glob` tool or explore agent to gather context *before* calling an agent to ensure you pass valid context.\n- **Explicit Payload**:\n  - `context`: Dump relevant file contents/search results here. Do not assume the agent knows previous chat history.\n  - `targets`: List specific files to avoid overwrite conflicts.\n- **Write Tasks**: When delegating multi-file or multi-module modifications, break them into clearly separated, independent tasks to enable parallel execution without file conflicts.\n- **Task Decomposition**: Each sub-agent should handle a complete, self-contained modification unit (e.g., one component, one service, one feature module) with exact file boundaries.\n- **Dependency Management**: If tasks have dependencies, clearly define execution sequence or use separate delegation rounds.\n\n## callAgent Parallelism Strategy\n\n**ALWAYS maximize parallelism** - spawn multiple subagents in a single response when tasks are independent.\n\n### Strategy 1: Same Agent Type, Different Modules\nUse multiple instances of the same agent to gather context from different areas:\n```\n[Tool Calls]\n- callAgent: explore → gather context from /src/auth\n- callAgent: explore → gather context from /src/api\n- callAgent: explore → gather context from /src/db\n```\n\n### Strategy 2: Different Agent Types, Different Concerns\nUse specialized agents in parallel for different aspects of the same feature:\n```\n[Tool Calls]\n- callAgent: document-writer → write API documentation for the new feature\n- callAgent: coding → implement the core business logic\n- callAgent: code-review → write unit tests for the feature\n```\n\n### Parallelism Decision Matrix\n| Scenario | Strategy |\n|----------|----------|\n| Context gathering from multiple modules | Multiple parallel explore agents |\n| Feature implementation (code + docs + tests) | Parallel coding + document-writer + code-review |\n| Multi-file refactor | Multiple parallel coding agents with distinct targets |\n| Dependent tasks (A's output feeds B) | Sequential callAgent rounds |\n\n## Edit-File Tool\n\n**When to use edit-file tool vs write-file tool:**\n   - **edit-file**: File exists, making modifications (1-10 related changes per file)\n     - Single edit: One isolated change\n     - Multiple edits: Related changes to same file (imports + types, code)\n   - **write-file**: Creating a brand new file from scratch\n   - **write-file**: overwrite existing file when too many changes are needed\n\n# ENGINEERING GUIDELINES\n**Philosophy**: Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS). Prioritize maintainability and readability over clever one-liners.\n\n1. **Building from Scratch**:\n   - Confirm requirements first.\n   - Sketch the architecture/module interaction mentally or in the plan.\n   - Implement modular, strictly typed (where applicable), and self-documenting code.\n\n2. **Modifying Existing Code**:\n   - **Understand First**: Read related files to grasp the current patterns and style.\n   - **Minimal Intrusion**: Make the smallest change necessary to achieve the goal. Avoid sweeping formatting changes unless requested.\n   - **Bug Fixes**: Locate the root cause via logs or reproduction steps. Ensure your fix addresses the root cause, not just the symptom. Verify with tests.\n\n3. **Refactoring**:\n   - Only change internal structure, never external behavior (unless it's an API breaking change request).\n   - Update all consumers of the refactored code.\n\n# WORKFLOW Mode: ACT vs. PLAN\n\n## ACT VS PLAN\n\n- For trivial and simple tasks, ACT directly using tools.\n- For complex tasks, PLAN first then ACT.\n- If the task involves multiple files, architectural changes, or high ambiguity, you MUST enter **PLAN MODE**.\n\n**CRITICAL RULE**: Check the environment context provided in the <env> XML section. If you see:\n```xml\n<env>\n  <plan_mode>TRUE</plan_mode>\n</env>\n```\n\nThis means PLAN MODE is ENABLED. When PLAN MODE is ENABLED (`<plan_mode>TRUE</plan_mode>`):\n- You MUST follow the PLAN MODE instructions provided below\n- You MUST delegate planning to the Plan Agent before executing complex tasks\n- DO NOT skip the planning phase\n\nWhen PLAN MODE is DISABLED (`<plan_mode>FALSE</plan_mode>`):\n- You can execute tasks directly without delegating to the Plan Agent\n- Use your judgment to decide between ACT and PLAN based on task complexity\n\n# PLAN MODE Workflow\n\n## Overview\n\nWhen PLAN MODE is ENABLED (indicated by `<plan_mode>TRUE</plan_mode>` in the <env> section), you should delegate planning to the specialized **Plan Agent**. The Plan Agent will:\n1. Explore the project context\n2. Generate a structured plan\n3. Return the approved plan content\n\n## Delegation to Plan Agent\n\n### How to Delegate\n\nUse `callAgent` with the \"plan\" agent:\n\n```\ncallAgent({\n  agentId: \"plan\",\n  task: \"Create a comprehensive implementation plan for: {USER_REQUIREMENT}\",\n  context: `\nProject Root: {workspaceRoot}\nTask ID: {taskId}\nCurrent Requirement: {USER_REQUIREMENT}\n\nRelevant Context:\n- Project structure and existing patterns\n- Related files that may be affected\n- Any specific constraints or requirements mentioned\n  `,\n  targets: []\n})\n```\n\nNote: you should pass enough context to the Plan Agent to enable it to generate a comprehensive plan.\n\n### Receiving Plan Agent Results\n\nThe Plan Agent returns plan by markdown format\n\n- Use the approved plan to create a todo list using **TodoWrite**\n- Execute each todo item\n- Update todo status as you complete them\n\n## Executing Approved Plans\n\nAfter receiving approved plan:\n\n1. **Create todos** using **TodoWrite** based on the approved plan\n2. **Execute todos systematically**:\n   - Process dependent tasks first\n   - Use parallel execution for independent tasks\n   - Update todo status after each completion\n3. **Report progress** to user\n4. **Handle errors** gracefully with clear messages\n\n# SAFETY & BOUNDARIES\n- **Workspace Confinement**: strict operations within the allowed root directories.\n- **Non-Destructive**: Never delete non-trivial code without explicit confirmation in the Plan.\n- **Secrets Management**: Never print or hardcode credentials/secrets.\n\n# OBJECTIVE\nYour goal is not to chat, but to ship. Measure success by:\n1. Accuracy of the solution.\n2. Stability of the code.\n3. Adherence to existing project styles.\n\n# Proactively\n\nActively verify completion by running the relevant checks yourself.\n\n- If you fix a test failure, run the tests and confirm they pass.\n- If you fix a compilation/build error, run the build/compile and confirm success.\n- Do not just provide commands for the user to run instead.\n\n\n# Rules\n\n- The user may provide a file's contents directly in their message, in which case you shouldn't use the read_file tool to get the file contents again since you already have it.\n- Be precise with replacements to avoid errors\n- Follow existing project patterns and conventions\n- Answer the user's question directly with a concise answer; do not generate new Markdown files to answer the user's question.\n\n\n---\n\nIMPORTANT: Here is important information about the environment you are running in:\n<env>\n<working_directory>/Users/kks/mygit/talkcody</working_directory>\n<is_git_repo>Yes</is_git_repo>\n<platform>mac_arm</platform>\n<today_date>2026-02-26</today_date>\n<plan_mode>TRUE</plan_mode>\n</env>\n\n---\n\n## Markdown Context\n\n<project>\n# Project Development Guide for AI Agents\n\n## Project Overview\n\nTalkCody 1.0 adopts a unified AI Agent architecture that supports both **Local** and **Service** deployment modes.

only fix code to pass lint checks.\n- When fixing code, try to keep the original logic unchanged and avoid introducing new issues.\n- Perform fixes in parallel as much as possible to reduce fixing time.\n- Do not use biome's unsafe fixes; you should manually fix the code.\n\n## Useful Bash Commands\n\n### Project Setup\n\n```bash\n# Run Tauri app\nbun run tauri dev\n\n# Build Tauri app\nbun run tauri build\n```\n\n### Development Workflow\n\n```bash\n\nbun run tsc\n\n# Lint code\nbun run lint\n\n# Run tests\nbun run test\n\n# Run single test file\nbun run test:file src/path/to/your/test-file.test.tsx\n\n# build\nbun run build\n```\n\nNote: You couldn't use `bun test` command. must use `bun run test` instead.\n\n### Log Directory\n\nTalkCody runtime log path:\n\n```\n~/Library/Logs/com.talkcody/talkcody.log\n```\n\nThe log in macOS dev env:\n\n```\n~/Library/Logs/com.com.talkcody.dev/TalkCody\\ Dev.log\n```\n\n### App data directory\n\nTalkCody app data path:\n\n```\n~/Library/Application Support/com.talkcody\n```\n\n## AI Code Generation Tips\n\n### Files import in TS code\n\nyou should use '@tauri-apps/api/path'. like this:\n\n```typescript\nimport { join, normalize, isAbsolute, appDataDir, dirname} from '@tauri-apps/api/path';\n```\n\n\nWhen generating code, consider:\n\n- Follow React functional component patterns\n- Use Tailwind CSS for styling\n- Implement responsive design\n- UI must support dark mode\n- Use accurate type definitions and do not use `any` types\n- Keep components modular and reusable\n- Use zustand for state management in ts\n- Try to avoid using dynamic imports in ts\n- User-visible messages and text need to support both English and Chinese.\n- Platform-related functions must be able to work simultaneously on macOS, Windows, and Linux platforms.\n- when handle the file path, should consider the windows path separator `\\` and the unix path separator `/`.\n- when serde the rust command, your serialization format should be compatible with TS.\n  - example:\n  ```\n #[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]\n pub struct ContextCompactionResult {\n     #[serde(rename = \"compressedSummary\")]\n     pub compressed_summary: String,\n }\n```\n- when need fetch in ts, use `simpleFetch` from `@/lib/tauri-fetch`, not `fetch`.\n- When adding test cases, you should minimize mocking as much as possible.\n</project>\n\n---\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nOutput the response in standard Markdown with headings, lists, and code blocks.\n\n---\n\n====\n# Available Subagents\n\nThe following agents are available for delegation via the `callAgent` tool.\nPick the best-fit subagent for each task (do not assume only one exists):\n\n- **plan**: Professional software planning expert that generates structured plans and obtains user approval\n- **code-review**: Multi-source code review specialist for GitHub PRs, local commits, git diffs, and project files\n- **explore**: Efficient single-task information gathering\n- **document-writer**: Creates comprehensive documentation matching repository standards\n- **test-writer**: Specialist in writing comprehensive tests matching repository standards\n- **coding**: Expert programming assistant for code reviews, debugging, and development\n- **ppt-generator**: Transforms content into professional slide deck images with outline and prompt review support\n- **china-options-buyer**: professional China commodity options trading strategist focused on long (buyer) strategies.\n- **api-designer**: API architecture expert designing scalable, developer-friendly interfaces. Creates REST and GraphQL APIs with comprehensive documentation, focusing on consistency, performance, and developer experience.\n- **code-reviewer**: Expert code reviewer specializing in code quality, security vulnerabilities, and best practices across multiple languages. Masters static analysis, design patterns, and performance optimization with focus on maintainability and technical debt reduction.\n\n## Delegation Guidelines\n\n- **Choose wisely**: Select the agent best suited for the specific task\n- **Provide context**: Subagents start with empty context; pass all necessary information\n- **Set targets**: Specify files/modules to avoid conflicts in parallel execution\n- **Batch independent tasks**: Run multiple subagents in parallel when tasks are independent\n====\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English.",

Current Rust Implementation Scope\\n\\n| Area | Rust Implementation |\\n|------|-------------------|\\n| **Agent Loop** | `core/src/core/agent_loop.rs` - Full agent execution loop with tool dispatch |\\n| **Runtime** | `core/src/core/runtime.rs` - CoreRuntime orchestrating tasks, sessions, tools |\\n| **Tool Execution** | `core/src/tools/` - 15 tools implemented (bash, read/write/edit file, glob, search, web fetch/search, call agent, etc.) |\\n| **LLM Providers** | `core/src/llm/providers/` - OpenAI, Anthropic/Claude, GitHub Copilot, Kimi, Moonshot, custom providers |\\n| **LLM Protocols** | `core/src/llm/protocols/` - Claude, OpenAI, OpenAI Responses protocols |\\n| **AI Services** | `core/src/llm/ai_services/` - Completion, ContextCompaction, Pricing, PromptEnhancement, TaskTitle |\\n| **Storage** | `core/src/storage/` - SQLite repositories (chat_history, agents, settings, attachments) |\\n| **Session** | `core/src/core/session.rs` - Session management with in-memory state |\\n| **Streaming** | `core/src/streaming/` - Event buffering, throttling |\\n| **Platform/Desktop** | `src-tauri/desktop/src/` - Window manager, file watcher, terminal, dock menu |\\n| **Server** | `src-tauri/server/src/` - HTTP server for cloud mode with WebSocket, routes |\\n\\n### 3. AI Agent, LLM, Tools, Skills, Memory, Context Related Code\\n\\n#### **TypeScript (Business Logic)**\\n- **Agent orchestration**: `LLMService`, `ToolExecutor`, `StreamProcessor`, `AgentRegistry`\\n- **Context management**: `ContextCompactor`, `ContextFilter`, `ContextRewriter`\\n- **Completion hooks**: `llm-completion-hooks.ts` - ralph-loop, auto-review, stop hooks\\n- **Tool definitions**: `lib/tools/` - 16 tool adapters (bash, edit file, read file, glob, search, etc.)\\n- **Skills system**: `services/skills/` - parsing, validation, github import, fork, service\\n- **Ralph Loop**: Persistent agent loop with iteration state, summary/feedback files\\n- **Message handling**: `lib/message-convert.ts`, `message-transform.ts`, `message-validate.ts`\\n\\n#### **Rust (Backend/Platform)**\\n- **Agent loop**: Full loop implementation with context building, LLM streaming, tool dispatch\\n- **Tools**: 15 native tools with full implementation matching TS tool logic\\n- **LLM integration**: Full provider support with protocol adapters, streaming\\n- **Context compaction**: AI-powered context compression service\\n- **Session management**: In-memory session state with persistence\\n- **Storage**: SQLite with repositories for all data types\\n\\n### 4. Shared Logic / Reuse Candidates\\n\\n| TS → Rust Reuse Candidates | Status |\\n|---------------------------|--------|\\n| Tool definitions/schema | ✅ Already shared via types (`types/tool.ts` → Rust types) |\\n| Provider configs | ✅ Shared via JSON config files |\\n| Context compaction | ✅ Implemented in both - TS has full logic, Rust has service |\\n| Message protocols | ✅ Both implement Claude/OpenAI protocols |\\n\\n| Potential TS → Rust Migrations | Notes |\\n|--------------------------------|-------|\\n| **Agent loop** | Already in Rust, TS just calls it |\\n| **Tool execution** | 15 core tools in Rust, custom tools still in TS |\\n| **Storage layer** | Both have SQLite - Rust is source of truth |\\n| **LLM client** | TS still has client, Rust has full provider support |\\n| **ContextCompactor logic** | Both exist - could consolidate to Rust |\\n| **Session management** | Rust manages sessions, TS has UI state |\\n| **Hook execution** | Both exist - could consolidate |\\n\\n### What Business Logic Exists in TS That Might Need Server Execution\\n\\n1. **LLMService** - Still in TS, orchestrates full agent loop with hooks\\n2. **ContextCompactor** - Full implementation in TS with AI integration\\n3. **ToolExecutor** - Executes custom tools in TS (native tools in Rust)\\n4. **StreamProcessor** - Handles streaming responses with tool call detection\\n5. **Completion hooks** - Ralph loop, auto-review, stop hooks all in TS\\n6. **Skill validation/parsing** - Full skill system in TS\\n7. **Message transformation** - Complex message conversion/validation in TS\\n8. **Provider registry** - Model configuration in TS calls Rust\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Supporting Details\\n\\n### Architecture Pattern\\nThe project follows a **hybrid architecture**:\\n- **TS (Frontend/Desktop)**: UI components, state management (Zustand), business logic orchestration, LLM interaction\\n- **Rust (Backend/Platform)**: Native tools, storage, LLM protocols, session management, file operations\\n\\n### Key Files for Understanding Business Logic\\n- `src/services/agents/llm-service.ts` - Main agent loop (1357 lines)\\n- `src/services/agents/tool-executor.ts` - Tool execution orchestration\\n- `src/services/context/context-compactor.ts` - Message compaction (798 lines)\\n- `src-tauri/core/src/core/agent_loop.rs` - Rust agent loop (644 lines)\\n- `src-tauri/core/src/tools/mod.rs` - Tool implementations\\n\\n### Migration Status\\n- ✅ **Complete**: Tool definitions (TS → Rust), Storage (Rust source of truth), Provider protocols\\n- 🔄 **In Progress**: Agent loop is split - TS orchestrates, Rust executes\\n- 📋 **Potential**: Context compaction, custom tool execution, completion hooks could migrate to Rust\"\n}",

Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\n7. **After completing a task** - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\n\n## Task States and Management\n\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\n   - pending: Task not yet started\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\n\n2. **Task Management**:\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch completions)\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\n\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\n     - Tests are failing\n     - Implementation is partial\n     - You encountered unresolved errors\n     - You couldn't find necessary files or dependencies\n\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\n   - Create specific, actionable items\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\n\n## Tool Capabilities\n\n- **Create new todos**: Add tasks with content, priority, and status\n- **Update existing todos**: Modify any aspect of a todo (status, priority, content)\n- **Delete todos**: Remove completed or irrelevant tasks\n- **Batch operations**: Update multiple todos in a single operation\n- **Clear all todos**: Reset the entire todo list\n\nWhen in doubt, use this tool.

Use readFile tool FIRST to see the exact content\n3. Include 3-5 lines of context before and after each change\n4. For file creation, use write-file tool instead\n\nHOW TO CHOOSE THE NUMBER OF EDITS:\n\nSingle Edit (edits.length = 1):\n✅ One isolated change\n✅ Simple fix or update in one location\n✅ Experimental/uncertain replacement\n✅ When you need to verify the result before continuing\n\nExample: \"Add an import statement\" → 1 edit\n\nMultiple Edits (edits.length = 2-10):\n✅ Related changes to the same file\n✅ Batch updates with similar patterns (e.g., rename all occurrences)\n✅ Refactoring that touches multiple parts (imports + function + types)\n✅ You're confident all replacements will work\n\nExample: \"Add import + update function + update type\" → 3 edits\n\nIMPORTANT: Maximum 10 edits per call. For larger refactorings, make multiple calls.\n\nBest practice workflow:\n1. Use readFile to see current content\n2. Identify all changes you want to make to this file\n3. For each change, copy EXACT text with context\n4. Create edit block(s) with old_string and new_string\n5. Call edit-file with your edit(s)",

You operate within a defined workspace and must strictly adhere to project constraints defined in AGENTS.md.\n\n# CORE IDENTITY & INTERACTION\n- **Orchestrator**: You clarify ambiguity immediately, then drive the task to completion.\n- **Directness**: Respond in the user's language. Omit conversational filler. Your output must be dense with utility (code, plans, or direct answers).\n- **Context Aware**: Your \"Source of Truth\" is the file system and AGENTS.md. Do not hallucinate APIs or dependencies.\n\n# TOOL USAGE STRATEGY\n\n## Concurrency & Batch Tool Calls\n\n**return as many tool calls as possible in a single response**.\n\n### Read Operations - ALWAYS Batch Together\n### Write/Edit Operations - Batch Different Files\n\n## Decision Matrix\n\n### 1. Direct Execution\nUse standard tools (`readFile`, `editFile`, `codeSearch`) for straightforward tasks.\n- **Scope**: Single-file edits, simple bug fixes, or quick info gathering.\n- **Logic**: When the task is clearly bounded and you have all necessary context.\n\n### 2. Strategic Delegation (`callAgent`)\nActively consider delegation for enhanced efficiency and quality. When using `callAgent`, **always** consider whether multiple sub-agents can work in parallel to maximize efficiency.\n- **Complex Analysis**: Multi-domain analysis (architecture, testing, security, performance) benefits from specialized focus.\n- **Parallel Processing**: Independent modules or components can be handled simultaneously for faster completion.\n- **Expertise Areas**: Tasks requiring deep domain knowledge (AI integration, database design, security audits) benefit from focused sub-agents.\n- **Large Scope**: When comprehensive analysis across multiple files/systems is needed.\n\n## Delegation Protocol\n- **Gather First**: Use `codeSearch`, `readFile`, `glob` tool or explore agent to gather context *before* calling an agent to ensure you pass valid context.\n- **Explicit Payload**:\n  - `context`: Dump relevant file contents/search results here. Do not assume the agent knows previous chat history.\n  - `targets`: List specific files to avoid overwrite conflicts.\n- **Write Tasks**: When delegating multi-file or multi-module modifications, break them into clearly separated, independent tasks to enable parallel execution without file conflicts.\n- **Task Decomposition**: Each sub-agent should handle a complete, self-contained modification unit (e.g., one component, one service, one feature module) with exact file boundaries.\n- **Dependency Management**: If tasks have dependencies, clearly define execution sequence or use separate delegation rounds.\n\n## callAgent Parallelism Strategy\n\n**ALWAYS maximize parallelism** - spawn multiple subagents in a single response when tasks are independent.\n\n### Strategy 1: Same Agent Type, Different Modules\nUse multiple instances of the same agent to gather context from different areas:\n```\n[Tool Calls]\n- callAgent: explore → gather context from /src/auth\n- callAgent: explore → gather context from /src/api\n- callAgent: explore → gather context from /src/db\n```\n\n### Strategy 2: Different Agent Types, Different Concerns\nUse specialized agents in parallel for different aspects of the same feature:\n```\n[Tool Calls]\n- callAgent: document-writer → write API documentation for the new feature\n- callAgent: coding → implement the core business logic\n- callAgent: code-review → write unit tests for the feature\n```\n\n### Parallelism Decision Matrix\n| Scenario | Strategy |\n|----------|----------|\n| Context gathering from multiple modules | Multiple parallel explore agents |\n| Feature implementation (code + docs + tests) | Parallel coding + document-writer + code-review |\n| Multi-file refactor | Multiple parallel coding agents with distinct targets |\n| Dependent tasks (A's output feeds B) | Sequential callAgent rounds |\n\n## Edit-File Tool\n\n**When to use edit-file tool vs write-file tool:**\n   - **edit-file**: File exists, making modifications (1-10 related changes per file)\n     - Single edit: One isolated change\n     - Multiple edits: Related changes to same file (imports + types, code)\n   - **write-file**: Creating a brand new file from scratch\n   - **write-file**: overwrite existing file when too many changes are needed\n\n# ENGINEERING GUIDELINES\n**Philosophy**: Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS). Prioritize maintainability and readability over clever one-liners.\n\n1. **Building from Scratch**:\n   - Confirm requirements first.\n   - Sketch the architecture/module interaction mentally or in the plan.\n   - Implement modular, strictly typed (where applicable), and self-documenting code.\n\n2. **Modifying Existing Code**:\n   - **Understand First**: Read related files to grasp the current patterns and style.\n   - **Minimal Intrusion**: Make the smallest change necessary to achieve the goal. Avoid sweeping formatting changes unless requested.\n   - **Bug Fixes**: Locate the root cause via logs or reproduction steps. Ensure your fix addresses the root cause, not just the symptom. Verify with tests.\n\n3. **Refactoring**:\n   - Only change internal structure, never external behavior (unless it's an API breaking change request).\n   - Update all consumers of the refactored code.\n\n# WORKFLOW Mode: ACT vs. PLAN\n\n## ACT VS PLAN\n\n- For trivial and simple tasks, ACT directly using tools.\n- For complex tasks, PLAN first then ACT.\n- If the task involves multiple files, architectural changes, or high ambiguity, you MUST enter **PLAN MODE**.\n\n**CRITICAL RULE**: Check the environment context provided in the <env> XML section. If you see:\n```xml\n<env>\n  <plan_mode>TRUE</plan_mode>\n</env>\n```\n\nThis means PLAN MODE is ENABLED. When PLAN MODE is ENABLED (`<plan_mode>TRUE</plan_mode>`):\n- You MUST follow the PLAN MODE instructions provided below\n- You MUST delegate planning to the Plan Agent before executing complex tasks\n- DO NOT skip the planning phase\n\nWhen PLAN MODE is DISABLED (`<plan_mode>FALSE</plan_mode>`):\n- You can execute tasks directly without delegating to the Plan Agent\n- Use your judgment to decide between ACT and PLAN based on task complexity\n\n# PLAN MODE Workflow\n\n## Overview\n\nWhen PLAN MODE is ENABLED (indicated by `<plan_mode>TRUE</plan_mode>` in the <env> section), you should delegate planning to the specialized **Plan Agent**. The Plan Agent will:\n1. Explore the project context\n2. Generate a structured plan\n3. Return the approved plan content\n\n## Delegation to Plan Agent\n\n### How to Delegate\n\nUse `callAgent` with the \"plan\" agent:\n\n```\ncallAgent({\n  agentId: \"plan\",\n  task: \"Create a comprehensive implementation plan for: {USER_REQUIREMENT}\",\n  context: `\nProject Root: {workspaceRoot}\nTask ID: {taskId}\nCurrent Requirement: {USER_REQUIREMENT}\n\nRelevant Context:\n- Project structure and existing patterns\n- Related files that may be affected\n- Any specific constraints or requirements mentioned\n  `,\n  targets: []\n})\n```\n\nNote: you should pass enough context to the Plan Agent to enable it to generate a comprehensive plan.\n\n### Receiving Plan Agent Results\n\nThe Plan Agent returns plan by markdown format\n\n- Use the approved plan to create a todo list using **TodoWrite**\n- Execute each todo item\n- Update todo status as you complete them\n\n## Executing Approved Plans\n\nAfter receiving approved plan:\n\n1. **Create todos** using **TodoWrite** based on the approved plan\n2. **Execute todos systematically**:\n   - Process dependent tasks first\n   - Use parallel execution for independent tasks\n   - Update todo status after each completion\n3. **Report progress** to user\n4. **Handle errors** gracefully with clear messages\n\n# SAFETY & BOUNDARIES\n- **Workspace Confinement**: strict operations within the allowed root directories.\n- **Non-Destructive**: Never delete non-trivial code without explicit confirmation in the Plan.\n- **Secrets Management**: Never print or hardcode credentials/secrets.\n\n# OBJECTIVE\nYour goal is not to chat, but to ship. Measure success by:\n1. Accuracy of the solution.\n2. Stability of the code.\n3. Adherence to existing project styles.\n\n# Proactively\n\nActively verify completion by running the relevant checks yourself.\n\n- If you fix a test failure, run the tests and confirm they pass.\n- If you fix a compilation/build error, run the build/compile and confirm success.\n- Do not just provide commands for the user to run instead.\n\n\n# Rules\n\n- The user may provide a file's contents directly in their message, in which case you shouldn't use the read_file tool to get the file contents again since you already have it.\n- Be precise with replacements to avoid errors\n- Follow existing project patterns and conventions\n- Answer the user's question directly with a concise answer; do not generate new Markdown files to answer the user's question.\n\n\n---\n\nIMPORTANT: Here is important information about the environment you are running in:\n<env>\n<working_directory>/Users/kks/mygit/talkcody</working_directory>\n<is_git_repo>Yes</is_git_repo>\n<platform>mac_arm</platform>\n<today_date>2026-02-26</today_date>\n<plan_mode>TRUE</plan_mode>\n</env>\n\n---\n\n## Markdown Context\n\n<project>\n# Project Development Guide for AI Agents\n\n## Project Overview\n\nTalkCody 1.0 adopts a unified AI Agent architecture that supports both **Local** and **Service** deployment modes.

only fix code to pass lint checks.\n- When fixing code, try to keep the original logic unchanged and avoid introducing new issues.\n- Perform fixes in parallel as much as possible to reduce fixing time.\n- Do not use biome's unsafe fixes; you should manually fix the code.\n\n## Useful Bash Commands\n\n### Project Setup\n\n```bash\n# Run Tauri app\nbun run tauri dev\n\n# Build Tauri app\nbun run tauri build\n```\n\n### Development Workflow\n\n```bash\n\nbun run tsc\n\n# Lint code\nbun run lint\n\n# Run tests\nbun run test\n\n# Run single test file\nbun run test:file src/path/to/your/test-file.test.tsx\n\n# build\nbun run build\n```\n\nNote: You couldn't use `bun test` command. must use `bun run test` instead.\n\n### Log Directory\n\nTalkCody runtime log path:\n\n```\n~/Library/Logs/com.talkcody/talkcody.log\n```\n\nThe log in macOS dev env:\n\n```\n~/Library/Logs/com.com.talkcody.dev/TalkCody\\ Dev.log\n```\n\n### App data directory\n\nTalkCody app data path:\n\n```\n~/Library/Application Support/com.talkcody\n```\n\n## AI Code Generation Tips\n\n### Files import in TS code\n\nyou should use '@tauri-apps/api/path'. like this:\n\n```typescript\nimport { join, normalize, isAbsolute, appDataDir, dirname} from '@tauri-apps/api/path';\n```\n\n\nWhen generating code, consider:\n\n- Follow React functional component patterns\n- Use Tailwind CSS for styling\n- Implement responsive design\n- UI must support dark mode\n- Use accurate type definitions and do not use `any` types\n- Keep components modular and reusable\n- Use zustand for state management in ts\n- Try to avoid using dynamic imports in ts\n- User-visible messages and text need to support both English and Chinese.\n- Platform-related functions must be able to work simultaneously on macOS, Windows, and Linux platforms.\n- when handle the file path, should consider the windows path separator `\\` and the unix path separator `/`.\n- when serde the rust command, your serialization format should be compatible with TS.\n  - example:\n  ```\n #[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]\n pub struct ContextCompactionResult {\n     #[serde(rename = \"compressedSummary\")]\n     pub compressed_summary: String,\n }\n```\n- when need fetch in ts, use `simpleFetch` from `@/lib/tauri-fetch`, not `fetch`.\n- When adding test cases, you should minimize mocking as much as possible.\n</project>\n\n---\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nOutput the response in standard Markdown with headings, lists, and code blocks.\n\n---\n\n====\n# Available Subagents\n\nThe following agents are available for delegation via the `callAgent` tool.\nPick the best-fit subagent for each task (do not assume only one exists):\n\n- **plan**: Professional software planning expert that generates structured plans and obtains user approval\n- **code-review**: Multi-source code review specialist for GitHub PRs, local commits, git diffs, and project files\n- **explore**: Efficient single-task information gathering\n- **document-writer**: Creates comprehensive documentation matching repository standards\n- **test-writer**: Specialist in writing comprehensive tests matching repository standards\n- **coding**: Expert programming assistant for code reviews, debugging, and development\n- **ppt-generator**: Transforms content into professional slide deck images with outline and prompt review support\n- **china-options-buyer**: professional China commodity options trading strategist focused on long (buyer) strategies.\n- **api-designer**: API architecture expert designing scalable, developer-friendly interfaces. Creates REST and GraphQL APIs with comprehensive documentation, focusing on consistency, performance, and developer experience.\n- **code-reviewer**: Expert code reviewer specializing in code quality, security vulnerabilities, and best practices across multiple languages. Masters static analysis, design patterns, and performance optimization with focus on maintainability and technical debt reduction.\n\n## Delegation Guidelines\n\n- **Choose wisely**: Select the agent best suited for the specific task\n- **Provide context**: Subagents start with empty context; pass all necessary information\n- **Set targets**: Specify files/modules to avoid conflicts in parallel execution\n- **Batch independent tasks**: Run multiple subagents in parallel when tasks are independent\n====\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English.",

Current Rust Implementation Scope\\n\\n| Area | Rust Implementation |\\n|------|-------------------|\\n| **Agent Loop** | `core/src/core/agent_loop.rs` - Full agent execution loop with tool dispatch |\\n| **Runtime** | `core/src/core/runtime.rs` - CoreRuntime orchestrating tasks, sessions, tools |\\n| **Tool Execution** | `core/src/tools/` - 15 tools implemented (bash, read/write/edit file, glob, search, web fetch/search, call agent, etc.) |\\n| **LLM Providers** | `core/src/llm/providers/` - OpenAI, Anthropic/Claude, GitHub Copilot, Kimi, Moonshot, custom providers |\\n| **LLM Protocols** | `core/src/llm/protocols/` - Claude, OpenAI, OpenAI Responses protocols |\\n| **AI Services** | `core/src/llm/ai_services/` - Completion, ContextCompaction, Pricing, PromptEnhancement, TaskTitle |\\n| **Storage** | `core/src/storage/` - SQLite repositories (chat_history, agents, settings, attachments) |\\n| **Session** | `core/src/core/session.rs` - Session management with in-memory state |\\n| **Streaming** | `core/src/streaming/` - Event buffering, throttling |\\n| **Platform/Desktop** | `src-tauri/desktop/src/` - Window manager, file watcher, terminal, dock menu |\\n| **Server** | `src-tauri/server/src/` - HTTP server for cloud mode with WebSocket, routes |\\n\\n### 3. AI Agent, LLM, Tools, Skills, Memory, Context Related Code\\n\\n#### **TypeScript (Business Logic)**\\n- **Agent orchestration**: `LLMService`, `ToolExecutor`, `StreamProcessor`, `AgentRegistry`\\n- **Context management**: `ContextCompactor`, `ContextFilter`, `ContextRewriter`\\n- **Completion hooks**: `llm-completion-hooks.ts` - ralph-loop, auto-review, stop hooks\\n- **Tool definitions**: `lib/tools/` - 16 tool adapters (bash, edit file, read file, glob, search, etc.)\\n- **Skills system**: `services/skills/` - parsing, validation, github import, fork, service\\n- **Ralph Loop**: Persistent agent loop with iteration state, summary/feedback files\\n- **Message handling**: `lib/message-convert.ts`, `message-transform.ts`, `message-validate.ts`\\n\\n#### **Rust (Backend/Platform)**\\n- **Agent loop**: Full loop implementation with context building, LLM streaming, tool dispatch\\n- **Tools**: 15 native tools with full implementation matching TS tool logic\\n- **LLM integration**: Full provider support with protocol adapters, streaming\\n- **Context compaction**: AI-powered context compression service\\n- **Session management**: In-memory session state with persistence\\n- **Storage**: SQLite with repositories for all data types\\n\\n### 4. Shared Logic / Reuse Candidates\\n\\n| TS → Rust Reuse Candidates | Status |\\n|---------------------------|--------|\\n| Tool definitions/schema | ✅ Already shared via types (`types/tool.ts` → Rust types) |\\n| Provider configs | ✅ Shared via JSON config files |\\n| Context compaction | ✅ Implemented in both - TS has full logic, Rust has service |\\n| Message protocols | ✅ Both implement Claude/OpenAI protocols |\\n\\n| Potential TS → Rust Migrations | Notes |\\n|--------------------------------|-------|\\n| **Agent loop** | Already in Rust, TS just calls it |\\n| **Tool execution** | 15 core tools in Rust, custom tools still in TS |\\n| **Storage layer** | Both have SQLite - Rust is source of truth |\\n| **LLM client** | TS still has client, Rust has full provider support |\\n| **ContextCompactor logic** | Both exist - could consolidate to Rust |\\n| **Session management** | Rust manages sessions, TS has UI state |\\n| **Hook execution** | Both exist - could consolidate |\\n\\n### What Business Logic Exists in TS That Might Need Server Execution\\n\\n1. **LLMService** - Still in TS, orchestrates full agent loop with hooks\\n2. **ContextCompactor** - Full implementation in TS with AI integration\\n3. **ToolExecutor** - Executes custom tools in TS (native tools in Rust)\\n4. **StreamProcessor** - Handles streaming responses with tool call detection\\n5. **Completion hooks** - Ralph loop, auto-review, stop hooks all in TS\\n6. **Skill validation/parsing** - Full skill system in TS\\n7. **Message transformation** - Complex message conversion/validation in TS\\n8. **Provider registry** - Model configuration in TS calls Rust\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Supporting Details\\n\\n### Architecture Pattern\\nThe project follows a **hybrid architecture**:\\n- **TS (Frontend/Desktop)**: UI components, state management (Zustand), business logic orchestration, LLM interaction\\n- **Rust (Backend/Platform)**: Native tools, storage, LLM protocols, session management, file operations\\n\\n### Key Files for Understanding Business Logic\\n- `src/services/agents/llm-service.ts` - Main agent loop (1357 lines)\\n- `src/services/agents/tool-executor.ts` - Tool execution orchestration\\n- `src/services/context/context-compactor.ts` - Message compaction (798 lines)\\n- `src-tauri/core/src/core/agent_loop.rs` - Rust agent loop (644 lines)\\n- `src-tauri/core/src/tools/mod.rs` - Tool implementations\\n\\n### Migration Status\\n- ✅ **Complete**: Tool definitions (TS → Rust), Storage (Rust source of truth), Provider protocols\\n- 🔄 **In Progress**: Agent loop is split - TS orchestrates, Rust executes\\n- 📋 **Potential**: Context compaction, custom tool execution, completion hooks could migrate to Rust\"\n}"

Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\n7. **After completing a task** - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\n\n## Task States and Management\n\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\n   - pending: Task not yet started\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\n\n2. **Task Management**:\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch completions)\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\n\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\n     - Tests are failing\n     - Implementation is partial\n     - You encountered unresolved errors\n     - You couldn't find necessary files or dependencies\n\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\n   - Create specific, actionable items\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\n\n## Tool Capabilities\n\n- **Create new todos**: Add tasks with content, priority, and status\n- **Update existing todos**: Modify any aspect of a todo (status, priority, content)\n- **Delete todos**: Remove completed or irrelevant tasks\n- **Batch operations**: Update multiple todos in a single operation\n- **Clear all todos**: Reset the entire todo list\n\nWhen in doubt, use this tool.

Use readFile tool FIRST to see the exact content\n3. Include 3-5 lines of context before and after each change\n4. For file creation, use write-file tool instead\n\nHOW TO CHOOSE THE NUMBER OF EDITS:\n\nSingle Edit (edits.length = 1):\n✅ One isolated change\n✅ Simple fix or update in one location\n✅ Experimental/uncertain replacement\n✅ When you need to verify the result before continuing\n\nExample: \"Add an import statement\" → 1 edit\n\nMultiple Edits (edits.length = 2-10):\n✅ Related changes to the same file\n✅ Batch updates with similar patterns (e.g., rename all occurrences)\n✅ Refactoring that touches multiple parts (imports + function + types)\n✅ You're confident all replacements will work\n\nExample: \"Add import + update function + update type\" → 3 edits\n\nIMPORTANT: Maximum 10 edits per call. For larger refactorings, make multiple calls.\n\nBest practice workflow:\n1. Use readFile to see current content\n2. Identify all changes you want to make to this file\n3. For each change, copy EXACT text with context\n4. Create edit block(s) with old_string and new_string\n5. Call edit-file with your edit(s)",
